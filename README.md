Object-oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker (node.js image generation)

**Welcome!**
In this assignment we are instructed to make a node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file.
As the app is initated, users will be instructed to a color, shape, and text to make their logo design.

## How to Run the app
You can run this application by going into the terminal command line of the main file, and type: node index.js, which will begin the prompts.

## Repo Structure
The repo is structured in this manner:
- index.js is where we run the application code
- library contains the various javascript files for shape constructor classes and the svg setup
- examples contains the finished output product after the user succesfully finishes all the prompts
- You can ignore assets, node modules, package.json, etc
